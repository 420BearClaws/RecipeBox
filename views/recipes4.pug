        li='Preheat oven to 425Â°F.'
        li='Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.'
        li='With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears.'
        li='Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.'
        li='Sprinkle with salt.'
        li='With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.'
        li='Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.'
        li='They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.'
        li='The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.'
        li='They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.'
